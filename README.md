# Onlineshop with Reactjs and mongodb 
The project constists of three applications front end, online-backend and admin page to access the products api.

## Frontend- with Reactjs
The application displays new collections,popular collections, different vategories for men, women and kids and weekly offers collections.

There is a login and signup page with **mongodb authentication**. With __async/await fetch method__  I accessed the mongodb database and access the users authentification token that was stored in the local storage. 

When you hit the log out button the application delete the authentication token and the page resets to log in.There is a cart that allows the user to select items and remove unwanted items before cashing out.
